# AI-Powered Voice Assistant

## Overview
The AI-powered voice assistant is designed to provide users with hands-free interaction by understanding and responding to voice commands. Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, this assistant enhances accessibility, automates tasks, and improves user experience.

## Features
- *Speech Recognition:* Converts spoken words into text for processing.
- *Natural Language Understanding (NLU):* Identifies user intent and extracts relevant details.
- *Text-to-Speech (TTS):* Converts AI-generated responses back into speech.
- *Custom Commands:* Users can define and execute personalized commands.
- *Integration with APIs:* Fetches real-time data such as weather, news, and reminders.
- *Secure User Interaction:* Ensures privacy and data protection through encrypted communication.

## Technologies Used
- *Natural Language Processing (NLP):*
  - Google Speech-to-Text, OpenAI GPT models, SpaCy
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  - Intent Recognition
- *Machine Learning:*
  - TensorFlow, PyTorch for model training
  - Scikit-learn for classification and sentiment analysis
- *Backend Development:*
  - Python (Flask/FastAPI for API development)
  - Node.js (optional, if needed for real-time processing)
- *Cloud Deployment:*
  - AWS, Google Cloud, Azure
  - Docker for containerization
  - Kubernetes (optional for scaling)
- *Database:*
  - SQL/NoSQL for storing user preferences and command history

## Installation
### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.7+
- Node.js (optional, if using for API backend)
- Docker (for containerization)

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shree-mithaa/AiVoiceAssisstant.git
   cd ai-voice-assistant
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
